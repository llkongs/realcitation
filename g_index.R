# This function is used for calculating the g-index. 
# The definition of g-index is : putting a researcher's article in a descending 
# way by citation, the first g articles has the total citation which is at least
# equal to g^2. 
# If g is biger than the number of total articles, it will return 
# a "pseudo g-index" which equals to the floored value of the square root of 
# the summartion of all articles citation.
# Make sure that there is only one researcher in the data.
